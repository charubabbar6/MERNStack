<!--"semantic" refers to the use of HTML elements that convey the meaning and structure of the content, rather than just its appearance. Semantic HTML elements provide additional information about the content they contain, which helps both browsers and developers understand the content more accurately.

Importance of Semantic HTML
Accessibility:

Semantic elements make web content more accessible to people using screen readers and other assistive technologies. For example, using <header>, <nav>, and <footer> helps screen readers navigate a page more effectively.
SEO (Search Engine Optimization):

Search engines can better understand and index the content of a webpage when semantic elements are used. This can improve the page's search engine ranking.
Maintainability:

Using semantic HTML makes the code more readable and maintainable. It is easier for developers to understand the structure and purpose of the content.
Standards Compliance:

Semantic HTML helps ensure that the webpage adheres to web standards set by organizations like the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).-->
