          home to 13 million people.

          Ireland boss James Topping 'really excited' to see Hugo Keenan impact
        </h3>
        <p>
          Hugo Keenan has "fitted in perfectly" and coach James Topping expects
          the Ireland star to light up the Olympic Sevens tournament. Having
          made a high-profile return to the sevens set-up following Leinster's
          Champions Cup final defeat at the end of May, Keenan missed out on the
          URC play-offs and Ireland’s Test series against the Springboks.
