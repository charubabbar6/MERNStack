      <p class="intro">
        Web accessibility is crucial for ensuring that everyone, including
        people with disabilities, can use and interact with websites and web
        applications.
      </p>
      <p class="special">
        One of the main reasons for the importance of website accessibility is
        the growing number of people with disabilities. According to the World
        Health Organization and the CDC, 16% of the world's population, and 26%
        of the U.S. population, have a disability.

        The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone
        regardless of disability is an essential aspect.
