        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p class="steps">
          1. Add the cashews to a spice grinder, blender or a mixer-grinder. Use
          cashews that are at room temperature and not refrigerated ones.Grind
          the kaju to a smooth and fine powder, but make sure you don't over do
          the grinding process as fat should not release from the
          cashews.Remember to grind in short intervals. The cashews should be in
          powder form and not become pasty or buttery like cashew butter.If
          there are tiny pieces in the cashew powder, then just let them be. Or
          opt to sieve the cashew powder and set aside. Use a medium fine sieve
          and not a fine one to sift the powdered cashews.
        </p>

        <p class="steps">
          2. On a low flame heat sugar and water in a thick bottomed or non
          stick pan or kadai. Meanwhile grease a plate or a tray and keep aside
          or keep butter papers ready.When all the sugar has dissolved in the
          water, add the cashew powder. There is no consistency in the sugar
          syrup required like one string or two string. Simply let the sugar
          dissolve in the water and then proceed with the next step.Mix and keep
          on stirring the cashew mixture non-stop on a low flame.The cashew
          mixture would start thickening.Cook the kaju mixture for approx 7 to 9
          minutes until the whole dough starts to come together.
        </p>
        <p class="steps">
          3. Remove the whole lump of the kaju dough from the pan and place it
          on your work surface or in a bowl or plate.Add the rose petals and
          ghee or oil to the cashew mixture.When the heat in the dough is hot
          enough to handle, then knead the cashew mixture lightly.Flatten the
          dough and place it on a butter paper or on a greased plate or
          tray.Place a butter paper on top and then using a rolling pin, roll
          gently the dough from all sides till you reach a thickness of 3 to 5
          mm in the dough.Remove the butter paper and let the rolled dough
          cool.When completely cooled, using a sharp knife cut the cashew dough
          giving square or diamond shapes.Gently remove the kaju barfi with a
          butter knife.Serve the kaju katli straight away or keep in an airtight
          container.
