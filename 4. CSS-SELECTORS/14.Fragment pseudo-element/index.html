      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup Rice Flour – 150 grams</li>
        <li>1.5 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Ghee or oil</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh grated coconut – 100 grams</li>
        <li>
          1 cup finely chopped jaggery or grated or powdered jaggery – 200 grams
        </li>
        <li>
          1 teaspoon cardamom powder or 6 to 7 green cardamoms, powdered in a
          mortar-pestle & husks removed
        </li>
        <li>
          ¼ teaspoon grated nutmeg or ground nutmeg powder (jaiphal powder),
          optional
        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon poppy seeds (khus khus), optional</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat ghee in a pan. Keep heat to a low. Add poppy seeds. Fry for some
          seconds till the poppy seeds start crackling. Then add grated fresh
          coconut, jaggery, cardamom powder and grated nutmeg. Mix well and cook
          this coconut-jaggery mixture on a low heat. The jaggery will melt
          first. Stirring often cook this mixture for 7 to 9 minutes till the
          moisture from the jaggery begins to dry. Turn off the heat. Don’t
          overcook as the jaggery then hardens. Keep this coconut-jaggery
          filling aside to cool. Note that on cooling, this stuffing mixture
          will thicken more. You can also add a bit of rice flour to this
          mixture. This is an optional step. The rice flour helps to absorb
          moisture, if any from the filling.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a pan add water, oil or ghee and salt. Keep it on the stove top.
          Let this mixture come to a boil. Reduce the heat and add the rice
          flour gradually. Quickly stir and mix the flour with the water. Stir
          till all the rice flour is mixed with the water. Switch off the heat.
          Remove the pan from the stove top and then cover this pan with a lid
          for 4 to 5 minutes. Now take all the dough in a large plate or thali
          or in a bowl. Gather the dough together and begin to knead it. The
          dough will be hot when, you begin to knead. So apply some water on
          your palms and knead the dough. Knead the dough very well. If you feel
          the dough looks dense or hard or dry, then just add a few teaspoons of
          warm water and continue to knead. Make small balls from the dough.
          Roll the balls till smooth in your palms. You can also apply some
          water on your palms, while rolling the balls. Keep the balls covered
          with a kitchen towel. The balls should be smooth in appearance and
          should not have any cracks.
        </li>
        <li>
          ake a ball and flatten it with your fingers to a round disc or a
          shallow bowl shape. You can apply ghee or oil in your palms while
          flattening. Place the sweet filling in the center. Flute and press the
          edges. Bring together all the edges and join them. Remove the extra
          portion of the dough from the top, if any. Shape and taper the top of
          the modak with your fingers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grease the modak mould with a bit of ghee or oil. Then close or lock
          the mould. Put the dough ball inside the mould and press it so that a
          space is made. Place the sweet stuffing inside. Cover the bottom with
          a small piece of dough. Press and smoothen it sealing the modak. Open
          or unlock the modak mould. Remove the modak gently from the mould.
          Shape all modaks this way with mould. Keep the shaped modak covered
          with a napkin so that the rice dough does not dry out. Make all the
          modak this way.
        </li>
        <li>
          Grease a steamer pan lightly with oil or ghee. Place the shaped modak
          in the greased pan with some space between them. Cover with a kitchen
          napkin. Take 2 to 2.5 cups water in a pot, pressure cooker or an
          Instant Pot steel insert. Place a trivet or a rack. Heat the water on
          high flame until begins to boil. For instant pot, use the sauté option
          and let the water begin to boil. The water should be hot or boiling
          when you place the modak in the large pan. Cover the pan and steam
          modak for 10 to 15 minutes on a medium-low heat. On the Instant Pot,
          use the steam function on high for steaming and keep the steam vent in
          venting position so that the steam releases while steaming. Use a stop
          watch to set the time to 10 or 12 minutes. Once the ukadiche modak are
          steamed, you can drizzle a few teaspoons of ghee on them. Note that
          after steaming, the modak should not feel sticky to touch. If the feel
          sticky, then steam for a few more minutes. Offer the Modak to Bhagwan
          Ganesha.
