<!-- Grocery Store Inventory Manager - Functional Approach
Grocery Store Inventory Manager Exercise

Objective: Enhance your JavaScript skills by implementing a functional approach to manage a grocery store's inventory. This exercise focuses on array manipulation, ES6 features like arrow functions and Object.assign(), and fundamental programming concepts like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Instructions:

Setup Your Environment: Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., inventoryManager.js)

Implement Inventory Functions:

addItem(name, category, price, quantity): Adds a new item to the inventory.

updateItem(name, newDetails): Updates an existing item's details in the inventory.

deleteItem(name): Removes an item from the inventory.

searchItem(name): Searches for an item by name and returns its details.

listInventory(): Returns a list of all items in the inventory.

Follow the Functional Programming Approach: Avoid using classes. Instead, use functions and store the inventory as an array of objects.

Ensure Code Quality: Write clean, readable, and well-documented code. Use ES6 features where appropriate.

Review and Refine: After successfully passing all tests, review your code. Look for opportunities to improve efficiency or readability.

Learning Outcome:

Upon completing this exercise, you will have a better understanding of JavaScript ES6 features, functional programming principles, and how to perform CRUD operations in a practical scenario. This exercise will also strengthen your skills in writing unit tests and ensuring code quality. -->
