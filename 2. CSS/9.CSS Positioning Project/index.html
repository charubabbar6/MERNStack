            Node.js is a popular open-source runtime environment that allows you
            to run JavaScript code server-side. It is built on Chrome's V8
            JavaScript engine and is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and
            scalable. Node.js is widely used for developing server-side
            applications, APIs, and real-time applications.

            React.js, often simply referred to as React, is a popular
            open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces,
            particularly single-page applications where you need a fast,
            interactive, and dynamic user experience. Developed and maintained
            by Facebook, React allows developers to create large web
            applications that can update and render efficiently in response to
            data changes.
