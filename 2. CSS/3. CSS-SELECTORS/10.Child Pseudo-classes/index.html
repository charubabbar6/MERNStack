          <h2>What is Java?</h2>
          <p>
            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
            language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as
            possible. It follows the principle of "write once, run anywhere"
            (WORA), which means that code written in Java can run on any device
            that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

          <h2>What is the Java ClassLoader?</h2>
          <p>
            The Java ClassLoader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment that
            dynamically loads Java classes into the JVM.

          <h2>What are Java Streams?</h2>
          <p>
            Java Streams are a new abstraction introduced in Java 8 that allows
            processing sequences of elements in a functional style. They support
            operations like filter, map, and reduce.

          <h2>What is bytecode in Java?</h2>
          <p>
            Bytecode is the intermediate representation of your Java program,
            which is executed by the JVM. It is platform-independent, making
            Java a platform-independent language.
