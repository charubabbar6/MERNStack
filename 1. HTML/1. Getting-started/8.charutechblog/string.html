            Why are strings immutable in Java?
          </button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Strings in Java are immutable, meaning once a String object is
              created, it cannot be changed. This immutability is a fundamental
              design decision that provides several significant advantages:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Security: Strings are widely used for storing sensitive data
                like usernames, passwords, and other configuration details.
                Immutability ensures that these values cannot be altered once
                created, thereby enhancing security. For instance, if a String
                representing a database URL is immutable, it cannot be changed
                after it has been set.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thread Safety: In a multithreaded environment, immutable objects
                are inherently thread-safe. Since String objects cannot be
                changed once created, they can be shared among multiple threads
                without synchronization. This eliminates the need for complex
                synchronization mechanisms, reducing the risk of concurrency
                issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                Caching and Optimization: The immutability of String allows for
                various optimizations. For example, the Java String Pool (or
                intern pool) is a special memory region where String literals
                are stored. When a new String is created, the JVM first checks
                the pool. If the String already exists, the JVM returns a
                reference to the pooled instance instead of creating a new one.
                This reduces memory usage and improves performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Efficient Hashing: Strings are commonly used as keys in
                hash-based collections like HashMap. The immutability of String
                ensures that the hash code remains constant once computed. This
                makes the behavior of hash-based collections predictable and
                reliable, as the key's hash code will not change over time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Design Simplicity: Immutable objects are simpler to design,
                implement, and use. They don't require complex mechanisms to
                ensure consistency or handle different states. This simplicity
                can lead to fewer bugs and easier maintenance.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The immutability of String in Java provides security, thread
              safety, efficiency, and simplicity. These benefits make it a
              crucial feature that contributes to the robustness and performance
              of Java applications.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              The intern() method in Java is used to optimize memory usage by
              ensuring that all identical String objects share the same memory.
              When a String object is interned, it is added to the Java String
              Pool (also known as the intern pool) if it is not already present,
              and any subsequent calls to intern() with the same String will
              return the same instance from the pool.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                String Pool: The String Pool is a special memory area in the
                heap where Java stores literal strings and interned strings.
              </li>
              <li>
                String Literal: When a string literal is created in Java, the
                JVM checks the String Pool to see if an identical string already
                exists. If it does, the reference to the existing string is
                returned. If not, the new string is added to the pool.
              </li>
              <li>
                intern() Method: The intern() method can be called on any String
                object. When called, it checks the String Pool for an identical
                string:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If the string is found in the pool, the reference to the
                    existing string is returned.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the string is not found, it is added to the pool, and the
                    reference to the newly added string is returned.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Why Use intern()?</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Memory Optimization: By interning strings, you can ensure
                    that identical strings are stored only once in memory,
                    reducing memory usage.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Performance: Comparing interned strings using == is faster
                    than using equals() because == checks for reference
                    equality.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>How intern() Works Internally</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Internally, the intern() method is native and interacts with
                    the JVM’s String Pool:
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When intern() is called, the JVM performs the following
                    steps:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        It checks if the string is already in the String Pool.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If the string is found, it returns the reference to the
                        pooled string.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If the string is not found, it adds the string to the
                        pool and returns the reference to the newly added
                        string.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Example code:<br />Here’s a simple example to illustrate how
              intern() works:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
              public class StringInternExample {
                public static void main(String[] args) {

                    String s2 = new String("hello");
                    String s3 = s2.intern();
            
                    System.out.println(s1 == s2); // false
                    System.out.println(s1 == s3); // true
                }

            How many objects are created in Strings using string literals and
            new operator?
          </button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              When discussing how many objects are created in Java using string
              literals and the `new` operator, it's essential to understand how
              the Java String Pool works. Here's an explanation and an example:
            </p>

            <h3>String Literals</h3>
            <p>
              String literals are stored in the String Pool, which is a special
              memory area in the heap. When a string literal is created, the JVM
              checks if the string already exists in the pool:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the string exists, the JVM returns a reference to the
                existing string.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the string does not exist, the JVM creates a new string in
                the pool and returns a reference to it.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>New Operator</h3>
            <p>
              The `new` operator always creates a new String object in the heap,
              even if an identical string exists in the String Pool.
            </p>

            <h3>Example and Object Creation</h3>
            <pre><code>
public class StringObjectCreation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "hello";   // String literal
        String s2 = "hello";   // Same string literal, points to the same object in the String Pool

        String s3 = new String("hello"); // Creates a new object in the heap
        String s4 = new String("hello"); // Creates another new object in the heap
    }
}
            </code></pre>

            <p>Let's analyze how many objects are created in this example:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <code>String s1 = "hello";</code>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    One string literal "hello" is created in the String Pool.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>String s2 = "hello";</code>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    No new object is created. `s2` references the same object in
                    the String Pool as `s1`.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>String s3 = new String("hello");</code>
                <ul>
                  <li>One new object is created in the heap.</li>
                  <li>
                    The string literal "hello" already exists in the String
                    Pool, so no new string in the pool is created.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <code>String s4 = new String("hello");</code>
                <ul>
                  <li>One new object is created in the heap.</li>
                  <li>
                    The string literal "hello" already exists in the String
                    Pool, so no new string in the pool is created.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Total Number of Objects</h3>
            <p>
              One object in the String Pool for the literal "hello". Two objects
              in the heap created by the `new` operator.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, in total, <b>three</b> String objects are created: One in the
              String Pool. Two in the heap.
            </p>

            <h3>Explanation for Other Cases</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Using Only String Literals:</b>
                <pre><code>
String a = "test";
String b = "test";
                </code></pre>
                <p>Only one object is created in the String Pool.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Using New Operator:</b>
                <pre><code>
String c = new String("test");
String d = new String("test");
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                  Two new objects are created in the heap, while the literal
                  "test" already exists in the String Pool.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Understanding this mechanism helps in optimizing memory usage and
              performance in Java applications.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              The String Constant Pool (also known as the String Intern Pool) in
              Java is a special memory region where Java stores string literals.
              This pool allows for efficient memory usage by ensuring that
              identical string literals are stored only once.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's a detailed explanation of how the String Constant Pool
              works:
            </p>

                <b>String Literals:</b>

                  <li>
                    When a string literal is created in Java, the JVM checks the
                    String Constant Pool to see if an identical string already
                    exists.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the string exists, the JVM returns a reference to the
                    existing string.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the string does not exist, the JVM creates a new string
                    in the pool and returns a reference to it.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Using the `new` Operator:</b>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The `new` operator always creates a new String object in the
                    heap, even if an identical string exists in the String Pool.

                  <li>
                    These new objects are not added to the String Pool unless
                    explicitly interned using the `intern()` method.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The `intern()` method can be called on any String object.
                    When called, it checks the String Pool for an identical

                  <li>
                    If the string is found in the pool, the reference to the

            <p>
              Understanding how the String Constant Pool works can help optimize
              memory usage and improve performance in Java applications. By
              using string literals and the `intern()` method wisely, you can
              minimize the number of String objects created and ensure that
              identical strings are stored only once in memory.

            <h3>== Operator</h3>
            <p>
              The <code>==</code> operator is used to compare the references of
              two objects to see if they point to the same memory location.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> Compares if two references point to
                the same object in memory.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    For primitive types (e.g., <code>int</code>,
                    <code>char</code>), <code>==</code> compares the actual
                    values.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    For reference types (e.g., objects), <code>==</code> checks
                    if two references point to the same object instance in
                    memory.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Example:</strong></li>
              <pre><code>
  String s1 = new String("hello"); 
  String s2 = new String("hello"); 
  
  System.out.println(s1 == s2); // false, because s1 and s2 refer to different objects in memory
                  </code></pre>
            </ul>
            <h3>equals Method</h3>
            <p>
              The <code>equals</code> method is used to compare the contents or
              logical equivalence of two objects. It checks if the objects have
              the same value or state.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> Compares if the contents or state of
                two objects are logically equivalent.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The <code>equals</code> method can be overridden in a class
                    to define what it means for two objects to be considered
                    equal.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The default implementation in the <code>Object</code> class
                    is similar to <code>==</code>, but many classes override
                    <code>equals</code> to compare actual contents.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Example:</strong></li>
              <pre><code>
  String s1 = new String("hello"); 
  String s2 = new String("hello"); 
  
  System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true, because s1 and s2 have the same content
                  </code></pre>
            </ul>
            <h3>Detailed Comparison</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reference Comparison vs. Content Comparison:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>==</code>: Compares object references (memory
                    locations).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>equals()</code>: Compares object contents (values),
                    assuming it is overridden in the class.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Default Behavior:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>==</code>: The default comparison is reference-based.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>equals()</code>: The default implementation in
                    <code>Object</code> is reference-based, but many classes
                    provide a custom implementation to compare contents.
                  </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Usage with Strings:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>==</code> will check if two
                    <code>String</code> references point to the same memory
                    location.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>equals()</code> will check if two
                    <code>String</code> objects have the same sequence of
                    characters.
                  </li>
                </ul>

              <strong>String:</strong> <br />
              <strong>Immutability:</strong> Strings are immutable in Java,
              meaning once a String object is created, it cannot be changed. Any
              modification to a String creates a new String object.<br />
              <strong>Thread Safety:</strong> Strings are inherently thread-safe
              due to their immutability.<br />
              <strong>Performance:</strong> Concatenation with Strings can be
              less efficient as it creates multiple intermediate String
              objects.<br />
              <strong>Use Case:</strong> Best when strings are not modified
              after creation or where immutability is needed.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>StringBuffer:</strong> <br />
              <strong>Mutability:</strong> StringBuffer is mutable, allowing
              modifications without creating new objects.<br />
              <strong>Thread Safety:</strong> It is synchronized, making it
              thread-safe for concurrent modifications.<br />
              <strong>Performance:</strong> Generally slower than StringBuilder
              due to synchronization overhead.<br />
              <strong>Use Case:</strong> Suitable for scenarios where thread
              safety is required and frequent modifications are needed.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>StringBuilder:</strong> <br />
              <strong>Mutability:</strong> Like StringBuffer, StringBuilder is
              mutable and allows modifications without creating new objects.<br />
              <strong>Thread Safety:</strong> It is not synchronized, making it
              faster but not thread-safe.<br />
              <strong>Performance:</strong> Faster than StringBuffer as it does
              not have synchronization overhead.<br />
              <strong>Use Case:</strong> Best for single-threaded scenarios
              where performance is critical and thread safety is not a concern.
